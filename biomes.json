I'm creating a 2d game with biomes. list 10 biomes. list 3-5 soil types for each biome and specify approximate ratios of sand, silt and clay for each. Use json format
please use a type like this 

type Soil = { name: string; description: string; contents: {
    "sand": number,
    "silt": number,
    "clay": number,
    "organic": number
  }
}
type Biome = { name: string; soils: SoilType[]
}

Here are terrain feature soils
